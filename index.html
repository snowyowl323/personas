            <p class="description">In this project, I analyzed an interface in a public space. The interface that I
                chose is the soft serve ice cream machine in my college cafeteria. Next, I created questions to ask
                people about their experience with the interface and to better understand their interaction in getting
                ice cream. Using the my observations of three users as well as their responses to my questions, I made
                two personas for people who use the soft serve machine in the cafeteria. Finally, I created a storyboard
                to document a personas interaction with the interface.</p>

                    <p>For this project, I chose to analyze the use of the soft serve ice cream machine in my
                        college cafeteria. The soft serve machine experience involves grabbing a bowl, plate, or cone,
                        placing container under the machine, and pulling a lever to dispense ice cream. Then, once the
                        container is full to the user's satisfaction, they can choose to add sprinkles or crushed oreos
                        on top from a station to the left of the machine. Next, I created some questions to ask users
                        about their experience with the soft serve machine:</p>
                    <ol id="questions">
                        <li>On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is easy and 10 is diffult, how easy or difficult was it to
                            use the ice cream machine?</li>
                        <li>Have you used an ice cream machine before? (If yes) How often do you use a
                            machine? (If no) How did you figure out how to use the machine?</li>
                        <li>What did you like most about the ice cream machine experience?</li>
                        <li>What was your least favorite part of using the ice cream machine experience?</li>
                        <li>How much time would you be willing to spend to get ice cream?</li>

                anticipation of being able to eat ice cream. One respondent noted that it was helpful that you could
                dispense ice cream more slowly by pulling the lever part of the way down.</li>
            <li>Their least favorite parts were the pressure of having to use the machine in front of other people and

                cream machine much less frequently.

                    shortest, but will go even if the line is a few minutes. Ethan represents the users who got ice
                    cream often but are more self concious/shy.</p>

                <p class="storyboard-caption">Ethan just finished his dinner at the college cafeteria. He wants
                    something sweet, and today he decides he wants ice cream. He looks at the ice cream machine line and
                    even though there are a few people, he decides to get in line for ice cream.</p>

                <p class="storyboard-caption">While Ethan is waiting in line for ice cream, he grabs a bowl from under
                    the counter. He prefers bowls over cones because they are better for toppings.</p>

                <p class="storyboard-caption">Once he gets to the front of the line, Ethan uses his right hand to hold
                    the bowl under the machine's ice cream dispenser.</p>

                <p class="storyboard-caption">While he holds the bowl with his right hand, Ethan uses his left hand to
                    pull the lever while he moves his right hand
                    in a circle to create vague swirling motion. Ethan feels rushed by the people behind him in line so
                    he tries to fill the bowl as quickly as possible.</p>

                <p class="storyboard-caption">Ethan moves out of line, and then asks if he can squeeze through line to
                    get to the toppings station. He heaps crumbled oreos into his bowl.</p>
